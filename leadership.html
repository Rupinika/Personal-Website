                    <p>
                        I believe that leadership is about empowering others and creating positive change. 
                        Throughout my time in school, I've actively sought opportunities to lead and serve 
                        my community.

                            <p>
                                Serving as class secretary has taught me the importance of organization, 
                                communication, and attention to detail. In this role, I've helped coordinate 
                                class events, maintain records, and ensure that student voices are heard 
                                in decision-making processes.

                            <p>
                                As a club president, I've had the opportunity to lead a group of passionate 
                                students, organize events, and drive initiatives that align with our shared 
                                interests and goals. This role has strengthened my skills in delegation, 
                                team management, and strategic planning.

                                Running for class president has been an incredible learning experience. 
                                It has allowed me to connect with my peers, understand their concerns and 
                                aspirations, and develop a vision for how we can work together to improve 
                                our school community.

                                In my role as vice president, I've learned the value of supporting leadership 
                                and working collaboratively to achieve common goals. I've gained experience 
                                in stepping up when needed while also knowing when to step back and support 
                                others.

                    <h2>DECA</h2>
                    <p>
                        My involvement with DECA has been a significant part of my leadership journey. 
                        DECA has provided me with opportunities to develop my skills in business, 
                        entrepreneurship, and professional communication. Through DECA, I've learned about:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="deca-list">
                        <li>Business strategy and entrepreneurship</li>
                        <li>Professional presentation and communication skills</li>
                        <li>Market analysis and business planning</li>
                        <li>Networking and building professional relationships</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        DECA has also sparked my interest in tech entrepreneurship, combining my passion 
                        for technology with business acumen. I'm excited about the potential to create 
                        innovative solutions that address real-world problems.

                    <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
                    <p>
                        Beyond school leadership roles, I'm committed to making a positive impact in my 
                        community. I've consistently participated in community service activities and 
                        initiatives that align with my values of service, compassion, and making a difference.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Leadership Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        I believe that effective leadership is not about being in charge, but about taking 
                        care of those in your charge. My leadership philosophy is built on:

                        even greater impact. I look forward to taking on new leadership challenges, 
                        mentoring others, and contributing to initiatives that create positive change 
                        in my school and community.
