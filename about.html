                        <h2>My Journey</h2>
                        <p>
                            My educational journey has been a path of growth, discovery, and transformation. 
                            It began at SSCPS (South Shore Charter Public School), where I first discovered 
                            my love for learning and community. From there, I moved to Woodland Elementary, 
                            where I began to explore my interests more deeply and developed a sense of 
                            curiosity about the world around me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At Stacy Middle School, I truly began to come into my own. It was here that I 
                            discovered my passion for technology and leadership. I learned to balance 
                            academics with extracurricular activities, and I started to understand the 
                            importance of being an active participant in my school community. The 
                            challenges I faced and the opportunities I embraced during these formative 
                            years helped shape my character and ambitions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now at Milford High School, I continue to grow and evolve. I've matured into 
                            someone who values hard work, curiosity, and determination. Each school has 
                            been a stepping stone, teaching me valuable lessons about resilience, 
                            adaptability, and the importance of staying true to myself while pushing 
                            boundaries and exploring new possibilities.
                        </p>

                        <h2>My Values</h2>
                        <div class="values-grid">
                            <div class="value-card">
                                <h3>Curiosity</h3>
                                <p>I believe in asking questions, exploring new ideas, and never stopping 
                                the pursuit of knowledge. This curiosity drives my passion for computer 
                                science and technology.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Leadership</h3>
                                <p>I strive to lead by example, inspire others, and create positive change 
                                in my community. Leadership is about empowering others and working 
                                collaboratively toward common goals.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Determination</h3>
                                <p>I approach challenges with resilience and persistence. Whether it's 
                                mastering a new programming language or running for class president, 
                                I commit fully to achieving my goals.</p>

                        <h2>Culture & Heritage</h2>
                        <p>
                            My connection to my culture and religion, Hinduism, is an integral part of 
                            who I am. Celebrating festivals like Holi has taught me about the importance 
                            of community, joy, and coming together with others. These experiences have 
                            shaped my outlook on life, reminding me that there's beauty in diversity, 
                            strength in unity, and joy in celebration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My cultural background has instilled in me values of respect, compassion, 
                            and gratitude. It has also given me a unique perspective that I bring to 
                            everything I do, whether it's working on a technology project, leading a 
                            school club, or collaborating with peers from different backgrounds.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                        <p>
                            As I continue my journey, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. My goal 
                            is to study computer science at MIT, where I can further develop my technical 
                            skills and contribute to innovations that make a difference. I'm committed to 
                            continuing to grow as a leader, an innovator, and a person who makes a 
                            positive impact on the world around me.
