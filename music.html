                    <h2>My Musical Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        Music has been a constant and cherished part of my life for as long as I can 
                        remember. It's more than just a hobby—it's a form of expression, a way to 
                        connect with others, and a source of joy and discipline.
                    </p>

                            <h3>Guitar</h3>
                            <p>
                                I've been playing guitar since 5th grade, and it's become one of my 
                                favorite ways to express myself musically. The guitar has taught me 
                                about patience, practice, and the reward of mastering a skill over time. 
                                Whether I'm strumming chords or picking melodies, the guitar provides 
                                a creative outlet that balances the technical aspects of my other interests.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Violin</h3>
                            <p>
                                Playing violin in orchestra has been an incredible experience. It's taught 
                                me about collaboration, listening, and the beauty of creating music 
                                together with others. The discipline required for violin practice has 
                                translated to other areas of my life, teaching me the importance of 
                                dedication and attention to detail.

                            <h3>Singing</h3>
                            <p>
                                Singing allows me to express emotions and tell stories through music. 
                                Whether performing solo or as part of a group, singing brings joy and 
                                connection. It's a way to share my voice—both literally and figuratively—with 
                                the world.

                    <h2>The Impact of Music</h2>
                    <p>
                        Music has shaped me in countless ways. It has:
                    </p>

                        <li><strong>Taught me discipline:</strong> Regular practice and commitment are 
                        essential for musical growth, lessons that apply to all areas of life</li>
                        <li><strong>Fostered creativity:</strong> Music provides a creative outlet that 
                        complements my technical interests in computer science</li>
                        <li><strong>Built confidence:</strong> Performing in front of others has helped 
                        me develop confidence in public speaking and presentation</li>
                        <li><strong>Created connections:</strong> Music brings people together and has 
                        helped me build meaningful relationships</li>
                        <li><strong>Provided balance:</strong> Music offers a welcome break from 
                        academic and technical pursuits, helping me maintain a well-rounded life</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Performances</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've had the opportunity to perform in various settings, from school concerts 
                        to community events. Each performance is a chance to share my passion for music 
                        and connect with audiences.
                    </p>
                    <div class="performance-placeholder">
                        <p>Performance videos and recordings coming soon!</p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>Music & Technology</h2>
                    <p>
                        My love for music and technology often intersect. I'm interested in exploring 
                        how technology can enhance musical experiences, from digital audio production 
                        to using programming to create music. This intersection of creativity and 
                        technology is something I find particularly exciting and want to explore further.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                    <p>
                        Music will always be an important part of my life. As I continue to grow as a 
                        musician, I look forward to new challenges, new pieces to learn, and new 
                        opportunities to share my music with others. Whether it's through solo 
                        performances, orchestra, or casual jam sessions, music will continue to be 
                        a source of joy, growth, and expression.
